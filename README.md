Welcome to Fully Fledged! a work-in-progress forge mod that adds pigeons into the game. (CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE ANY FEATURES, JUST THE MOST BASIC OF CODE)

feel free to comment on any features/potential balance issues; this is my first ever mod and i want it to be fun AND playable!!

CURRENT PLANS:
- 
- can give pigeons decorational pigeon harnesses/pants using carpet, just like llamas!
- roost/nest block for pigeons to chill when they arent making deliveries
- nicknaming a rock dove "meep" or "martha" will change its texture to my own bird from real life and the extinct passenger pigeon respectively
- terrible pigeon nests when bred. we all know them
- can put hats/helmets on pigeons

THE PIGEONS:
- rock doves/everyday domestic pigeons.

  - spawn in villages, mansions, and pillager outposts

  - used to make deliveries to other players in multiplayer servers. all pigeons can do this unless stated otherwise
- mushroom dodos.

  - spawn on mushroom islands

  - can scare off spiders and do a funny dance

  - cannot make deliveries
- screaming pouter pigeons.

  - spawn in ancient cities

  - if attacked, will make a sound similar to laughing doves (but MUCH louder) and alerts nearby sensors and shriekers
- phoenix capuchin/frillback pigeons.

  - spawn in bastions

  - a special delivery pigeon that cannot breed, but is immune to fire damage and even rise from its ashes if killed! (HUGE maybe on this, but if i can learn how to revive pets itll happen. i do know theres a revivable pets mod out there)

  - grants the player fire resistance if it sits on their head
- king dodos.
 
  - spawn in end cities and (small) end islands

  - sometimes walk straight off into the abyss but thats ok

  - if tamed/fed its favorite food (dunno which to go with yet), it will sit on the players head for a while and rescue them if they accidentally fall into the void

  - alternative food source to chorus fruit

  - cannot make deliveries

THE ITEMS:
- pigeon feathers
  - maybe the player can craft a really comfy bed that lets them sleep through the night even if there are monsters nearby?
  - should have at least one more use i think ..
- new plants to feed and/or tame the different pigeons
  - corn + popcorn
  - unnamed mushroom dodo fruit
  - unnamed king dodo fruit
